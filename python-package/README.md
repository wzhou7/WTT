# Collocated Topic Modeling Python Implementation

This repositoty implements the collocated topic modeling method in Python. This method is described in Jung, Zhou, & Smith (2024) with an illustrative study. There is also an R implementation available at the [WTTR](https://github.com/wzhou7/WTTR) repository.

# How to Use

To install this Python package from github, you need to clone that repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/wzhou7/WTTP.git
```
Then, install it in develop mode by run the following command from inside the root dir of the cloned repo:
```
pip install -e .
```
Now you can use the implemented functions to explore your data. See example study.
